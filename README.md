# Origins (NeoForge)

**This mod is still under construction, some functions may not work properly.**

This mod is a full rewrite of the [Origins Mod](https://github.com/Apace100/origins-fabric) on NeoForge platform.

This mod provide an "origin" system. Each of them have special effects, and you can select them when join world or use
`Orb of Origin` items. Also, you can use datapacks to customize origins.

## FAQ

### Any Extra Dependencies?

Currently, no dependencies are needed. But later I will add a config library to provide config system.

### When the game is loading saves, this mod is spam in the console?

This mod is incomplete. What you see in console is the datapack loading system cannot find the specific power types
since they are not implemented yet. After some updates I will implement them and these errors will disappear.

### Are datapacks for Fabric version capable with this mod?

Sadly not, Fabric version use their own logic to load datapacks but this mod load them with vanilla methods. They have
different data structure.
